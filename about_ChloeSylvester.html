        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr /> 
        <!-- this paragraph will talk about me and what my life is like outside of school -->
            <p>My name is <b>Chloe Sylvester</b>. I am a Junior in highschool at Padua Academy in Wilmington, Delaware. I come from a family of five with two dogs. My parents names are Cyndi and Tony, my sisters names are Madison and Emily, and my two dogs names are Piper and Oakley. I used to play softball as I was growing up, but now I do not play softball anymore and I play volleyball. I am also very busy due to having two jobs. I work at Claire's Fashions selling prom dresses and I teach kids tennis every Tuesday at Wilimington Friends Lower School. When growing up my mom used to always tell me a wuote before I went anywhere and I will remember it for the rest of my life.</p>

        <h1>What I Like To Do</h1>
        <!-- this paragraph talks about what I like to do on my spare time and how I spend my days -->
            <p>I mostly like to hang out with friends, when I am not working, do my homework, and when it is the summer time I love going to the beach. Usually when I hang out with my friends we go out to eat and then spend the night at one of our houses and then the next day do something together like shopping or going to the movies. I actually do not mind doing homework after school since I like to keep on top of my work. I have a set schedule so I go home, eat a snack, and then start my homework that I got from that day so I do not fall behind. Then once schools over and its the summer my family and I go down to our beach house in Lewis, Delaware and spend most of the summer down there. I prefer the beach over the pool because I like the space that the beach provides and how when you go into the ocean it is more fun than going into the pool. I love to read especially on the beach, but one of my favorite books is <i> Mary, Mary</i> written by James Patterson. </p>
        
        <h1> What I Want To Be</h1>
        <!-- this talks about my future occupation and what I want to be later in life -->
            <p> When I grow up I want to be a Dermatologist at my own practice. I have always wanted to be some sort of doctor growing up, but never really knew what kind. One day I stumbled across an Instagram page called "Dr.PimplePopper" and ever since then I wanted to be a Dermatologist. Dr. Sandra Lee, the doctor who runs the page, made helping people feel confident in their skin really interesting and something that I would love to do. I am super excited to be a Dermatologist and although I know it is going to be a lot of work I am excited to help others while doing something I love.</p>
        
        <h1>Fears and Phobias</h1>
        <!-- this is the things that scare me and give me nightmares -->
            <p>I do not have a ton of fears, but my all time worst fear is the open ocean. I love going in the ocean, but once my feet can not touch the ground I freak out. So that relates to my fear. Just imagine you are on a plane and it crashes and you are stranded in the middle of the ocean and fish, sharks, and whatever else is in the water is stalking you because they are curious to see what you are. Or if you are stuck out there for weeks suffering when I would have rather just passed away on impact than suffer.The open ocean is my biggest fear, but I also do not like spiders, snakes, sometimes heights and the thought of potentially being kidnapped.</p>
